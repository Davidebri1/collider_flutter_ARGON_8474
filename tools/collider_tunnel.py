"""The phone link. Made by Claude (2026-10-21).

David, 21 Oct: "So if I'm on my phone, I can't test this app? I can't run exe on iPhone can I? I'm in safari".
Collider is a web app served by this computer. Cloudflare's tunnel program (bin\\cloudflared.exe beside Collider.exe,
from Cloudflare's own releases) gives it a private https address that works from a phone anywhere, microphone included.
The address carries a key made fresh at each start; without it the server answers nothing that comes through the
tunnel, so nobody else can use the keys on this computer. The tunnel ends when Collider closes.
